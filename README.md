# java-complete-example

## Project description

## Files detailed

* .gitignore - contains extensions, files and directories which can't be uploaded to the repo. It means, repo should only have code files. You have to avoid upload files such as:
  * log - log files generated in local machines are completely unnecessary for the rest of the team.
  * jar - code compiled and packaged should not be stored in repo because that files depends on the host machine. So compilation has to be executed and stored in the destination machine.
  * ide files - Other developers in the same team could deploy in different IDE, so uploading files generated by IDE like ".idea" could brake other configurations.
  * target directory - this directory contains all jars from the project, so this directory should be in local machines.
* README.md - quick documentation in [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). This documentation can be exported to PDF in easy and quick way.
* logs directory - directory where logs files are stored
* example directory - directory with some examples of files to work with
* pom.xml - maven definition file. The file with all the components to build the project with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* src/main/resources/application.yml - contains all the config parameters used in the application
* src/main/resources/logback.xml - configuration for logger

### Directory structure convention

To work with Maven with default structure you have to create the following directories:

* src/main/java - store the java code
* src/main/resources - store the properties and other resources published in the classpath
* src/test/java - contains the tests
* src/test/resources - contains the properties and resources useful for tests
* target - directory used for Maven to build the project

## Best practices tips

* Don't reinvent the wheel - use libraries. In this project we are using:
  * SpringBoot - the easiest way to work with Spring Framework
  * FileUtils - utilities to manage files
  * StringUtils - utilities to manage strings
  * log4j - log framework
* Use a logger - Never ever use _println_, because you could overload the disk. In this example we are working with log4j.
* Avoid string constants inside code - we strongly recommend using a properties files to store all the constants. In this project we are working with **application.yml**
* Use custom exceptions - create custom exceptions to manage and control your errors
* Don't kill the messenger - if you catch an exception, please log the message that you catch
* Avoid "+" in string concatenation - use "String.format" instead. This method is more secure and efficient
* Be paranoid - you have to be paranoid checking potential errors like null pointers
* Delegate functionality - don't create a huge class with the whole code, divide functionality in little pills
* Write code thinking the reviewr is a serial killer
  * use autoexplained variable names
  * use comments inside the code
  * use java doc for all your methods
* Javadoc is your friend
* DEBUG - if you have running errors the best way to detect a fix them is using the debugger

## Git flow commands

1. Clone from repo `$ git clone git@github.com:oscarcpz/java-complete-example.git`
2. Create **develop** branch if it does not exists `$ git push -u origin develop`
3. Check status `$ git status`
4. Change to **develop** branch `$ git checkout develop`
5. Add all modified files `$ git add`
6. Commit changes `$ git commit -m "Changes..."`
7. Push to repo `$ git push`
